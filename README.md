 Googel Stocks

Contained in the repository is an early look at Google stock prices over the past two decades. We perform some basic data analysis to understand the distribution of opening and closing prices and follow this up with a time series analysis to check for any seasonality in Google stock performance. Our goal is to determine whether there are points within this 20-year period where the stock sold at higher prices and whether these patterns recur in a seasonal manner. We then compare these trends with any relevant news related to the company at those points.
