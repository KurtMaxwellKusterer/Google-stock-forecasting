Google Stock Time Series Analysis

This repository contains a Python script that performs a detailed time series analysis of Google’s stock. The analysis examines the seasonality of various metrics, including the opening and closing stock prices, over a period of 20+ years.

The goal is to identify fluctuations that may have impacted Google’s stock value, despite its reputation for stability. The key interest lies in detecting significant drop-offs in stock price and correlating these declines with global events. By doing so, we can better understand how shifts in the global economy affect even the most resilient industries.
